What is the difference between this and super?
this refers to the current class instance.

super refers to the parent class instance.

Example:
class A {
    int x = 10;
}

class B extends A {
    int x = 20;

    void print() {
        System.out.println(this.x);   // 20 (current class)
        System.out.println(super.x);  // 10 (parent class)
    }
}
