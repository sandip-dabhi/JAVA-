What is exception handling in Java?
Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors (exceptions) so that the normal flow of the application is not interrupted.

Java provides try, catch, finally, throw, and throws keywords for this.

Example:
try {
    int a = 5 / 0;  // This will throw ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
} finally {
    System.out.println("This block always executes.");
}
try block contains risky code

catch handles the exception

finally runs whether an exception occurs or not

throw is used to manually throw an exception

throws declares exceptions in method signature
