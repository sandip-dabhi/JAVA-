What is the difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer?
String is immutable, meaning once it's created, it can't be changed. Any operation like concatenation creates a new object.

StringBuilder is mutable and used to modify strings without creating new ones. Itâ€™s faster and not thread-safe.

StringBuffer is also mutable, but it is thread-safe, meaning it's safe to use in multi-threaded environments.
