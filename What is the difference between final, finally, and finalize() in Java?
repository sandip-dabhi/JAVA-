What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize() in Java?
final is a keyword used to restrict modification:

A final variable cannot be changed once assigned.

A final method cannot be overridden.

A final class cannot be extended.

finally is a block used in exception handling. It always executes after try-catch, whether an exception occurs or not.

finalize() is a method from the Object class that the garbage collector calls before destroying an object. Itâ€™s rarely used now and is considered deprecated in recent Java versions.
