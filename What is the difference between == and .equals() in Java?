What is the difference between == and .equals() in Java?
== compares object references (i.e., if two objects point to the same memory location).

.equals() checks for value equality (i.e., if two objects contain the same data).

The default equals() method in the Object class behaves like ==, but it's usually overridden in classes like String, Integer, etc.

Example:
String a = new String("hello");
String b = new String("hello");

System.out.println(a == b);        
System.out.println(a.equals(b));
