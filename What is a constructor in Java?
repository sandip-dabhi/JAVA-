What is a constructor in Java?
A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created. It has the same name as the class and no return type (not even void).

Key points:
It can be default (no parameters) or parameterized.

You can overload constructors by changing parameters.

If you donâ€™t define one, Java provides a default constructor.

public class Student {
    int id;
    String name;

    // Constructor
    public Student(int i, String n) {
        id = i;
        name = n;
    }
}
