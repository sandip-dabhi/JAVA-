What is a static keyword in Java?
The static keyword is used for class-level members (not tied to object instances). It can be applied to:

Variables – shared by all instances

Methods – can be called without creating an object

Blocks – used for static initialization

Nested classes

Example:
class Demo {
    static int count = 0;

    static void showCount() {
        System.out.println("Count: " + count);
    }
}
