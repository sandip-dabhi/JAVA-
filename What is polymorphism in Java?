What is polymorphism in Java?
Polymorphism means "many forms" â€” it allows one interface to be used for different data types or classes. In Java, there are two types:

Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading)

Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

Resolved during compile time.

Runtime polymorphism (Method Overriding)

Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.

Resolved during runtime using dynamic method dispatch.

Example:
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
