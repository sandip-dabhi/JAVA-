What is the Java Collection Framework?
The Java Collection Framework (JCF) is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable data structures like:

List → Ordered, allows duplicates (ArrayList, LinkedList)

Set → Unordered, no duplicates (HashSet, TreeSet)

Map → Key-value pairs (HashMap, TreeMap)

Queue → FIFO (PriorityQueue, LinkedList as Queue)

It provides algorithms, interfaces (Collection, List, Set, Map, etc.), and utility classes like Collections.
