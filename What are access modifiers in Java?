What are access modifiers in Java?
Access modifiers define visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables.

There are 4 main types:

public – accessible from anywhere

private – accessible only within the same class

protected – accessible within the same package and by subclasses

(default) – no modifier: accessible within the same package only

Example:

public class Example {
    private int a;          // accessible only within this class
    public int b;           // accessible from any class
    protected int c;        // accessible in same package and subclasses
    int d;                  // default access
}
