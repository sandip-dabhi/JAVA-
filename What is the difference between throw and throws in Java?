What is the difference between throw and throws in Java?
throw is used to manually throw an exception in the program.

throws is used to declare exceptions that a method might throw.

Example of throw:
throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");

Example of throws:
public void readFile() throws IOException {
    // some code that might throw IOException
}
Use throw to raise an exception, and throws to inform callers that an exception might occur.
