What is the purpose of the final keyword in Java?
The final keyword is used to prevent modification. It can be applied to:

Variables – value cannot be changed after initialization.

Methods – cannot be overridden in a subclass.

Classes – cannot be extended.

Example:

final int x = 10;
// x = 20;  // Error: can't change final variable

final class Animal {}
// class Dog extends Animal {}  // Error: can't extend final class
It’s used to create constants and enforce immutability or inheritance restrictions.
