What is the super keyword in Java?
The super keyword is used to refer to the parent class (superclass) in Java. It has a few main uses:

Access parent class methods when they are overridden.

Access parent class constructors.

Access parent class fields.

Example:
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        super.sound();  // Calls Animal's sound()
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
