What is inheritance in Java?
Inheritance is one of the core OOP principles that allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another class (parent/superclass).
This promotes code reuse and establishes a "is-a" relationship.

Example:
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}

Here, Dog inherits eat() from Animal. So an object of Dog can call both bark() and eat().
