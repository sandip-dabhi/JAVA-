What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?

----Abstract Class----

Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods

Can have constructors and instance variables

Supports inheritance (extends one abstract class)

Use when classes are closely related

----Interface----

Contains only abstract methods (until Java 7)

From Java 8+, can have default and static methods

Can only contain public static final variables

Supports multiple inheritance (a class can implement many interfaces)

Example:
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();
    void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}
