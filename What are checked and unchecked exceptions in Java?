What are checked and unchecked exceptions in Java?
Checked exceptions are checked at compile time. You must handle them using try-catch or declare them with throws.

Example: IOException, SQLException

Unchecked exceptions are checked at runtime. They are subclasses of RuntimeException.

Example: NullPointerException, ArithmeticException

Example:

// Checked exception
FileReader file = new FileReader("test.txt"); 
// Unchecked exception
int x = 5 / 0;
