What is method overloading and method overriding?
Method Overloading: Defining multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters (type, number, or order).

Happens at compile time.

Example:
void show(int a) {}
void show(String b) {}
Method Overriding: Redefining a method from the parent class in the child class with same signature.

Happens at runtime.
Requires inheritance.

Example:

class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
}
