What is encapsulation in Java?
Encapsulation is the practice of wrapping data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some of the objectâ€™s components.

You achieve this by:

Making variables private

Providing public getters/setters to access and modify them

Example:

class Person {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String newName) {
        name = newName;
    }
}
