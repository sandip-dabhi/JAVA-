What is multithreading in Java?
Multithreading allows multiple parts of a program to run simultaneously to improve performance, especially on multi-core processors.

Each thread runs independently but shares the same memory space.

You can create threads in two ways:

Extending Thread class

Implementing Runnable interface

Example:

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

MyThread t = new MyThread();
t.start();  // starts the thread
Multithreading is useful for tasks like file processing, downloading, animations, etc.
